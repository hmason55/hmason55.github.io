A tactical role-playing game that emphasizes player strategy, careful planning, and exploration.

## What is From the Dregs?
From the Dregs is a single player, fantasy themed, tactical role-playing game that emphasizes player strategy, careful planning, and exploration. Players will be able to create a unique character and delve through various dungeons, caverns, and other hostile environments to gather loot, battle enemies, and enhance their character’s abilities to fit their own playstyle.

## How can you help?
Community is extremely important to this project’s design, and player feedback will be gathered regularly for review. During the initial development cycle, content will be added for select players to test out so that necessary changes can be made before public builds are released. After the initial release, regular content updates will add new features such as items, levels, enemies, and playable heroes.
