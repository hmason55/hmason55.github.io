Community is extremely important to this project’s design, and player feedback will be gathered regularly for review. During the initial development cycle, content will be added for select players to test out so that necessary changes can be made before public builds are released.


## Surveys <img src="/assets/img/tome.png"  width="96" height="96">

You are encouraged to fill out an anonymous survey about your experience with the game after each new version. Responses will be recorded for evaluation but will only be used for development purposes and your responses will __never__ be distributed.
